# Hack to Kotlin

Let's learn how to use Kotlin with Spring Boot!
We will do that while converting a good old Java Spring Boot Rest service, with Lombok, to Kotlin.  
The goal of this workshop is not to learn Spring Boot modules or Maven, but how to use Kotlin with Spring Boot. 

So we expect you have basic knowledge of:
- Java 
- Lombok
- Spring Boot modules (Spring Web & Spring Data)
- Maven

*Approach*

We will start with converting simple POJO's, and move up to somewhat more complicated
parts of the project containing the business logic. 

Converting the project will happen in steps, steps are ordered in sections. 
So a section contains one or more recipes that provide the necessary information for completing it.

Complete the recipes in the sections in this order 

1) [project setup section](docs/section1-project-setup/Recipe.md) 
2) domain 
3) controller 
4) data 
5) service 
6) test

To get to know the better, read the following documents:

- [Recipe Api](docs/SETUP_AND_DESIGN.md)
- [Overal setup and design](docs/SETUP_AND_DESIGN.md)
- [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)
