**We assume that you already have some basic knowledge about Kotlin, but you want to go beyond that and learn how to use
it with the Spring Boot framework.
This workshop is here to help you with that.**

Note: *This project is created as part of the hands-on part of the hack-to-kotlin workshop. You may use it outside the
context of the workshop.*

## About this workshop

In this workshop you will start with migrating a good old Java Spring Boot Rest service to Kotlin by following
recipes.
In the recipes we will touch upon:

- the best practices of using Kotlin
- the Kotlin utilities you get out-of-the box
- the pitfalls of converting Java code straight to Kotlin
- Kotlin's interoperability with Java
- neat Kotlin features
- and more!

## What this workshop is not

Please keep in mind that the goal of this workshop is not to explain Java, Spring Boot modules or any other tool or
library, but to expand on
certain aspects that come in play when gradually
migrating a Java Spring Boot project to Kotlin. And be aware that this workshop does not cover what Spring offers! We
want to give
you a taste of what is
possible and later extend it based on requests from the community.
This workshop is not perfect! But with your help we can improve it.

## The Recipes

### Start converting Java-To-Kotlin

The first recipes in this workshop explain step-by-step what needs to be done to migrate the Java code.
Follow the recipes [here](recipes/java-to-kotlin/Intro.md) in the right order, and you will be done converting the Java
code to Kotlin in no time!
